//! <h1 align="center">üì° Searchlight</h1>
//!
//! Searchlight is an mDNS server & client library designed to be simple, lightweight and easy to use,
//! even if you just have basic knowledge about mDNS.
//!
//! In layman's terms, Searchlight is a library for broadcasting and discovering "services" on a local network.
//! This technology is part of the same technology used by Chromecast, AirDrop, Phillips Hue, and et cetera.
//!
//! **Searchlight is designed with user interfaces in mind.**
//! The defining feature of this library is that it keeps track of the presence of services on the network,
//! and notifies you when they come and go, allowing you to update your user interface accordingly,
//! providing a user experience that is responsive, intuitive and familiar to a scanning list for
//! WiFi, Bluetooth, Chromecast, etc.
//!
//! - **üåê IPv4 and IPv6** - Support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
//! - **‚ú® OS support** - Support for Windows, macOS and most UNIX systems.
//! - **üì° Broadcasting** - Send out service announcements to the network and respond to discovery requests. (mDNS server)
//! - **üëΩ Discovery** - Discover services on the network and keep track of their presence. (mDNS client)
//! - **üßµ Single threaded** - Searchlight operates on just a single thread, thanks to the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime & task scheduler.
//! - **ü§∏ Flexible API** - No async, no streams, no channels, no bullsh*t. Just provide an event handler function and bridge the gap between your application and Searchlight however you like.
//! - **üëª Background runtime** - Discovery and broadcasting can both run in the background on separate threads, providing a handle to gracefully shut down if necessary.
//! - **üì® UDP** - All networking, including discovery and broadcasting, is connectionless and done over UDP.
//! - **üîÅ Loopback** - Support for receiving packets sent by the same socket, intended to be used in tests.
//! - **üéØ Interface targeting** - Support for targeting specific network interface(s) for discovery and broadcasting.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! - **`broadcast` ·µà·µâ·∂†·µÉ·µòÀ°·µó**<br>Provides the [`Broadcaster`](broadcast::Broadcaster) type that will broadcast [`Service`](broadcast::Service)s on the network and respond to discovery requests.
//!
//! - **`discovery` ·µà·µâ·∂†·µÉ·µòÀ°·µó**<br>Provides the [`Discovery`](discovery::Discovery) type that will discover [`Responder`](discovery::Responder)s on the network and keep track of their presence, notifying you via [`DiscoveryEvent`](discovery::DiscoveryEvent)s.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Examples for [broadcasting](broadcast) and [discovery] can be found in the documentation for their respective modules.
